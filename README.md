## Description

I have been tasked to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

Step 1 -
Clone repository link into terminal
https://github.com/riz1ash786/note-taker

Step 2 -
Open terminal and install node modules using the following command `npm i`

## Usage

Step 3 -
Enter `node server.js` in terminal to start the application. Once a port has been presented in terminal then type `localhost:3000` into browser to display the application locally. Alternatively, use the Heroku link provided in the links section below.
